=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::DBInstance

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::DBInstance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::DBInstance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is used as a response element in the
C<DescribeDBInstances> action.

CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from
outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS
on AWS Outposts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html)

in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.


=head2 PubliclyAccessible => Bool

Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its DNS endpoint resolves
to the private IP address from within the DB instance's VPC, and to the
public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the
DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses, and
that public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to
the DB instance doesn't permit it.

instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see CreateDBInstance.

MySQL DB cluster for the Aurora read replica is shown. This output does
not contain information about cross region Aurora read replicas.

Currently, each RDS DB instance can have only one Aurora read replica.


=head2 ReadReplicaDBInstanceIdentifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

C<open-read-only>. For more information, see Working with Oracle Read
Replicas for Amazon RDS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide>.

This attribute is only supported in RDS for Oracle.

If present, specifies the name of the secondary Availability Zone for a
DB instance with multi-AZ support.
